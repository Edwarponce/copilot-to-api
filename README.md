## Introduction

GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI tool that assists developers by suggesting code and completing tasks. However, many developers seek to integrate Copilot's capabilities into their own applications. This repository offers a step-by-step guide to achieve that. 

With this guide, you will learn how to set up an API wrapper that interacts with GitHub Copilot and makes it compatible with OpenAI's API structure. This integration can streamline your development process and enhance your applications with AI capabilities.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Follow straightforward steps to get started.
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Make GitHub Copilot work seamlessly with OpenAI.
- **Node.js Support**: Built using Node.js for easy integration.
- **Comprehensive Tutorial**: Step-by-step instructions and examples.
- **Proxy Server**: Set up a proxy server to manage requests efficiently.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Edwarponce/copilot-to-api.git
cd copilot-to-api
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/Edwarponce/copilot-to-api/releases) section for pre-built binaries that you can download and execute directly.

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can start the API server. Use the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will launch the API, and you can start making requests to it. The API will act as a bridge between your application and GitHub Copilot, allowing you to harness its capabilities.

### Example Request

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the API:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function getCopilotSuggestion(prompt) {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/suggest', {
        prompt: prompt
    });
    console.log(response.data);
}

getCopilotSuggestion("Create a function to add two numbers.");
```

## How It Works

The API wrapper interacts with GitHub Copilot through its internal endpoints. By setting up a proxy server, you can manage requests and responses efficiently. 

1. **Request Handling**: The server listens for incoming requests and forwards them to GitHub Copilot.
2. **Response Management**: Once Copilot responds, the server processes the response and sends it back to the client.
3. **Error Handling**: The API includes error handling to manage issues gracefully.

This architecture allows you to integrate AI suggestions directly into your applications without dealing with the complexities of GitHub Copilot's internal workings.

## Topics Covered
